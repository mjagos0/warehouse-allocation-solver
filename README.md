## 📑 Description

This project addresses the **Warehouse Allocation Problem** using three optimization approaches:

1. **Local Search (LS)**  
2. **Evolutionary Algorithm (EA)**  
3. **Memetic Algorithm (MA)**  

Each method balances computational efficiency and solution quality, targeting large-scale problem instances effectively.
